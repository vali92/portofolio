As a Test Architect and Automation Developer for a web-based online banking application that provided customers access to their accounts through both the Web App and Mobile App, I had the opportunity to lead the testing efforts and ensure the delivery of a high-quality and secure banking experience. Also started implementing test automation frameworks for the core banking applications, various desktop and web apps.Here is an overview of my experience in this role:

- <b>Test Architecture Design</b> I designed a scalable and efficient test architecture that accommodated the complexities of the online banking application. This included determining the appropriate test automation frameworks, tools, and technologies, such as Selenium WebDriver, Sikuli, Cucumber or other relevant tools, for testing both the Web, Mobile Apps and desktop applications. I ensured that the architecture facilitated easy maintenance, reusability of test scripts, and efficient test execution across different platforms and devices.
- <b>Automation Framework Development</b> I led the development of a robust and maintainable automation framework to support end-to-end testing of the online banking application. This involved designing the framework's structure, implementing reusable functions and libraries, and integrating it with version control systems and continuous integration tools. The framework supported various types of tests, including functional, sanity and regression.
- <b>Test Script Development</b> I worked closely with automation engineers to develop and maintain automated test scripts for the online banking application. These scripts covered various scenarios and functionalities, including user authentication, account management, transaction processing, and data validation. I ensured that the test scripts were designed to handle the complexities of the banking application, such as multi-factor authentication, transaction verifications, and complex business workflows.
- <b>Cross-Platform and Cross-Browser Testing</b> The online banking application was accessible through multiple platforms and devices, including web browsers and mobile devices with different operating systems. I ensured that the automation framework and test scripts were capable of performing cross-platform testing, including compatibility testing across different browsers and mobile platforms.
- <b>Test Execution and Reporting</b> I oversaw the execution of automated tests for both the Web App and Mobile App, ensuring that test runs were scheduled and executed efficiently. I analyzed test results, identified defects, and reported them using a bug tracking system. I also generated comprehensive test reports to communicate the test coverage, execution status, and defect trends to stakeholders.



Here are some examples of the tools developed. The product owners asked for a desktop application where to execute test cases by themselves, workflow:
