As a Senior Test Automation Engineer, I had the opportunity to play a key role in developing and maintaining a new in-house test automation framework to enhance testing efficiency for the Client applications. Here is an overview of my responsibilities and accomplishments during this period:
- Developed a robust and scalable test automation framework using Java, TestNG, Spring, RestAssured, and Selenium. This framework served as the foundation for executing automation tests and facilitated seamless integration with the existing testing ecosystem.
- Created comprehensive test suites and test cases to automate API, database, and GUI testing. I designed and implemented automation scripts to cover functional, integration, smoke, and regression testing of web-based applications.
- Collaborated closely with the development team to analyze software bugs, investigate their root causes, and provide detailed feedback. I actively participated in defect triage sessions and worked with developers to ensure timely resolution of issues.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including business analysts, developers, and quality assurance teams, to align testing efforts and ensure that automation testing aligned with project goals and requirements.

As a QA Engineer, I played a critical role in ensuring the quality and performance of the CUBRID database management system. Here is a summary of my responsibilities and achievements during this role:

- Developed QA tools using Java to enhance testing, debugging, and infrastructure needs. These tools were designed to automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and streamline the QA process. They helped in detecting and resolving issues more effectively. Some examples:
   - Test automation framework to handle setup, test execution and reporting of a new DB functionality - Scalability
   - Performance automation tool using Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) This site was built using [Performance Report](https://github.com/vali92/portofolio/blob/main/Arnia%20Software%20-%20QA%20Automation%20Test%20Lead/performance_report_example.html)
   - Tool to gather test results from Jenkins and save them to a database + web app to check results
   - Tool to debug core dumps and take various actions e.g. send messages to Slack when detecting new cores, opening Jira issues or adding comments
   - Reporting tools to measure execution time and test status on X number of executions [Execution Time Report](https://github.com/vali92/portofolio/blob/main/Arnia%20Software%20-%20QA%20Automation%20Test%20Lead/Execution%20Time%20Report.html)
   - Tools to generate daily and weekly reports based on Nr of resolved/opened issues and automation test results [Daily Report](https://github.com/vali92/portofolio/blob/main/Arnia%20Software%20-%20QA%20Automation%20Test%20Lead/DailyReport.html) [Weekly Report](https://github.com/vali92/portofolio/blob/main/Arnia%20Software%20-%20QA%20Automation%20Test%20Lead/WeeklyReport.html)
   - Other various shell debugging tools
   - Jenkins shared library

- Utilized shell scripting to automate various QA tasks, such as database setup, data generation, and test environment configuration. These scripts facilitated the execution of complex testing scenarios, saving time and effort for the QA team.
- Created Jenkins pipeline jobs using Groovy scripting to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensured consistent and reliable execution of tests and helped in maintaining a continuous integration and delivery environment.
- Conducted extensive database testing to verify the functionality, stability, and performance of the CUBRID database management system. This involved designing and executing test cases to cover various aspects, including data manipulation, query optimization, data integrity
- Collaborated with the development team to analyze and resolve software bugs, providing detailed feedback and ensuring their timely resolution. I actively participated in defect triage meetings, conducted root cause analysis, and worked closely with developers to address and resolve issues efficiently.
- Performed performance testing using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) tool. This involved designing test scenarios, configuring benchmark parameters, and executing performance tests to measure the system's response time, throughput, and scalability under different workloads.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and system administrators, to align testing efforts, share test results, and provide feedback on product improvements.
- Actively participated in agile development practices, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, ensuring effective communication and collaboration within the team.
