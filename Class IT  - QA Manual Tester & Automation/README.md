As a QA Manual Tester, my primary responsibility was to ensure the quality and reliability of the software being developed. I worked closely with the development team to understand project requirements and create comprehensive test plans and test cases. Here are some key aspects of my experience in this role:

- <b>Test Planning</b> I collaborated with stakeholders to define test objectives, identify test scenarios, and prioritize testing activities based on project timelines and requirements. This involved analyzing business and functional specifications to create test strategies.

- <b>Test Execution</b> I executed test cases manually to validate software functionality, including regression testing, integration testing, and system testing. I logged defects and issues in a bug tracking system and worked closely with developers to investigate and resolve them.
  
- <b>Documentation</b> I created detailed test plans, test scripts, and test reports to provide comprehensive documentation of the testing process. This included documenting test results, identifying areas of improvement, and suggesting enhancements to the development team.
  
- <b>Communication and Collaboration</b> I actively participated in daily stand-up meetings, team discussions, and defect triage sessions to provide feedback and ensure efficient communication within the project team.

As a Junior Automation Tester, I started transitioning from manual testing to automated testing due to the fact that I wanted to evolve in this way, I started to search for myself and learn how I can achieve this.

- <b>Test Automation Framework</b> I created a very simple test framework. This involved using tools like Selenium and was written in C#.
- <b>Script Development</b> I wrote and executed automated test scripts to validate software functionality and perform regression testing.
- <b>Test Execution and Reporting</b> I executed automated test scripts, monitored test results, and reported defects using the bug tracking system.
